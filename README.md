# pantoneFinder

Pantone Color Finder<br>
The project was created to experiment with color data APIs and give users an easy tool to identify color names, RGB values, and close Pantone matches based on the color they input. It’s a fun, light, and educational tool for designers, artists, or anyone interested in color theory.

Built with:<br>
HTML – for structure<br>
CSS – for styling the layout and results<br>
JavaScript – for functionality and DOM manipulation<br>
The Color API – to fetch color information like name, hex, and RGB<br>
