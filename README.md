# pantoneFinder

Name: 
Pantone Color Finder
The project was created to experiment with color data APIs and give users an easy tool to identify color names, RGB values, and close Pantone matches based on the color they input.
It’s a fun, light, and educational tool for designers, artists, or anyone interested in color theory.

Built with:
HTML – for structure
CSS – for styling the layout and results
JavaScript – for functionality and DOM manipulation
The Color API – to fetch color information like name, hex, and RGB
